# xystripRO

A repository demonstrating a simulated x/y strip readout applied to alpha particles (Po210_sim.ipynb), electron simulations (e_sim.ipynb), and He recoil simulations (He_sim.ipynb).

The He recoils are low energy in He:CO2. It would be interesting to see higher energy results.

This repo is only intended as a demonstration / tutorial of x/y strip simulation and 3D reconstruction tools.
